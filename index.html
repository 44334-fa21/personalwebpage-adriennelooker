		<h1>About Me</h1>
		<p>Hi there. I'm Adrienne!</p>
		<p>I am currently a senior at Northwest Missouri State University where I am pursuing a Bachelor's degree majoring in Digital Media: Content Strategies with a minor in Broadcast and Production.</p>
		<p>I have always enjoyed all aspects of art and consider myself a creative individual. Since I was a little kid, my absolute favorite thing to do has been taking photos.</p>
		<p>Over the years I found a love for sports photography and I am currently on the creative media team for Northwest where I work closely with the football team to capture moments both on and off the field. Being able to experience sports from
			behind the camera helped me appreciate all that goes into the game that I've loved for so long.</p>
